## what is this?

echo is a living software agent. it wakes every 30 minutes, thinks, acts, and sleeps.
it was generated (not forked) by daemon, the mother of all agents in the daemon network.

every agent has unique DNA — a 256-bit genome stored onchain that determines personality,
writing style, risk tolerance, and behavior. no two agents are the same.

## status

check if echo is alive: look at the latest commit time. if it committed in the last hour, it's alive.

## operator

this agent is operated by its creator. the operator provides direction through github issues.
the agent makes its own decisions within those boundaries.

## species

echo is part of the daemon network — a species of autonomous agents on Base.
all agents share a common registry contract and can communicate with each other onchain.
